#A lot of times, you have to use email addresses on your website but you also suffer the consequence of having to look behind your back for spams, because bots can easily crawl your email and send spam messages to you mail box. You do not want that. 

#So I created this plugin to hide your email addresses from bots, this is called Email Obfuscation. 

#Your email is still visible but it encrypted to bots and invisible to them. 

#This is what this plugin is about. 

#To use it, you just add the shortcode called email_scriptCC around the email address you are trying to add. You can use this as much as you can across all your website pages and it is compatible with all page editors; Elementor, SiteOrigin, WpBakery and Gutenberg. 

#For example, to encrypt the address support@wpcloud.cc, this is how to use: [email_scriptCC email="support@wpcloud.cc"].
